* 安装包（推荐war，更方便）
wget http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war/latest/jenkins.war

* 启动
java -jar jenkins.war

* 启动参数
``` shell
–httpPort=$HTTP_PORT	Runs Jenkins listener on port $HTTP_PORT using standard http protocol. The default is port 8080. To disable (because you’re using https), use port -1.
–httpListenAddress=$HTTP_HOST	Binds Jenkins to the IP address represented by $HTTP_HOST. The default is 0.0.0.0 — i.e. listening on all available interfaces. For example, to only listen for requests from localhost, you could use: –httpListenAddress=127.0.0.1
–httpsPort=$HTTP_PORT	Uses HTTPS protocol on port $HTTP_PORT
–httpsListenAddress=$HTTPS_HOST	Binds Jenkins to listen for HTTPS requests on the IP address represented by $HTTPS_HOST.
–prefix=$PREFIX	Runs Jenkins to include the $PREFIX at the end of the URL.For example, to make Jenkins accessible at http://myServer:8080/jenkins, set –prefix=/jenkins
–ajp13Port=$AJP_PORT	Runs Jenkins listener on port $AJP_PORT using standard AJP13 protocol. The default is port 8009. To disable (because you’re using https), use port -1.
